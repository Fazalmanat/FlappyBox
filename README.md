# Flappy Box

Flappy Box is a fun twist on the classic Flappy Bird game. Instead of a bird, you control a box that can touch pillars without causing a game over. The game only ends when the box goes out of the screen, adding a new layer of challenge and fun!

## ðŸŽ® Features
- Control a **box** instead of a bird.
- **Game over only when you go off-screen**.
- **Pillars rotate the box** instead of causing an instant loss.
- Simple yet fun physics-based gameplay.
